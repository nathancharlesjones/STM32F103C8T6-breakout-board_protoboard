Breakout board for the venerable STM32F103C8T6 (a.k.a. the "Blue Pill") intended to be assembled by JLC PCB. Includes a small prototyping area which is intended to resemble the layout of a standard half-sized breadboard. All of the pads on the breadboard are connected through just a single trace on the bottom of the PCB. This allows some to be easily cut (using a hobby knife or small cutting tool such as a Dremel), which could allow for a slightly denser layout of some circuits.
